# Interfaces for the Linkflows model of reviewing

```index.html``` contains the code used to generate the graph for all dimensions of the review comments of the reviewers based on the Linkflows model of reviewing.

The data for the graph is obtained from a running NodeJS server instance. Now it is run locally and hardcoded. For testing purposes, use the ```data.csv``` file to generate the graph in case the NodeJS server is not available. This file contains the results from the SPARQL queries performed on the triple store where the data is uploaded.

THE CODE CURRENTLY NEEDS SOME "CLEANING" :)
